# ymca-reservation-bot
- a bot to reserve swim times at the local ymca (is this cheating ?)

swimming at the ymca is insannnely competitive, slots book out the second they are available. 
this custom bot, built with selenium, can book a time slot that you need if you provide it with:

1. the element ID of the time slot
2. the time the reservation should be booked
3. your username
4. your password
